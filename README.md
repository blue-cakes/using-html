# using-html
_HTML_- a world of webpages and web developers. HTML can be used for many purposes, and can be interwined with _many_ other languages, the most common being __CSS and JS__. In this ~~small~~ website, we'll be focusing mainly on HTML with CSS, along with brief explainations of every file (not that there are many). The file you are reading right now is `README.md`. README files are used for short explainations about the website, so that people viewing the code can understand what it is about. Usually, README files are used in __markdown__ file. Markdown is not visible to anyone viewing the website unless they open the code.
